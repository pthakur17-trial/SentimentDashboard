# Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A simple web application that **analyzes text to detect sentiment** (positive, neutral, or negative) and extracts key phrases, using **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services**. All results are stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** and can be viewed later.

This project is designed for **anyone curious about understanding text feedback**, whether from customers, social media, or reviews. You don’t need prior coding knowledge to get the idea!

## How It Works

1. User submits a text snippet to the app.
2. Azure **Text Analytics** processes the text:
   - Determines if it’s **positive, neutral, or negative**.
   - Finds the most important **keywords/phrases**.
3. Results are stored in **Cosmos DB**, a cloud database.
4. Users can fetch recent analyses to see trends.

This setup allows businesses or developers to quickly **track customer feedback, product reviews, or social media comments** in a structured way.
